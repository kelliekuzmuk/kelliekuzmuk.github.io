						<h2>Experiences</h2>
					</header>
					<p> I worked for the Vanderbilt University Student Centers as event staff, service associate, and box office staff during my sophomore, junior, and senior years at Vanderbilt. While there, I coordinated events with Vanderbilt and outside organizations, serving as a liason between Vanderbilt and the surrounding community. I also served as an informant on student life and campus affairs and was responsible for ticket transactions for on and off-campus events. I had the honor of being a part of VUcept during all 4 undergraduate years at Vanderbilt. VUcept is a peer mentorship program where I worked closely with a faculty mentor to facilitate weekly sessions to offer guidance, teach collegiate skills, and help first year students tap into campus resources. I also volunteered as a student research assistant for Vanderbilt's Memory and Alzheimer's Center on the NIH-funded Memory and Aging project. While there, I worked closely with a postdoctoral mentor and facilitated partcipant recruitment by providing information and project materials. To further my participation in academic research, I spent my summer as a research fellow for the Vanderbilt University Summer Research Program.  I designed and conducted a research study and presented my findings at the VUSRP poster presentation.</p>

						<h2>Interests</h2>
					</header>
						<p>I enjoy running, travel, and using my skills to help those around me. Along with running for Vanderbilt's NCAA Division I Women's Cross Country and Track teams, I also volunteered with Girls on the Run to share my passion for running with girls in the Nashville Community. I remained involved with Vanderbilt's Athletic Department by becoming an academic tutor for Student Athletes. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to study abroad during the Summer of 2012 at the University of Stirling in Scotland. During my time in Scotland, I grew to appreciate the unique culture as well as the beautful juxtaposition of modern urban life and historic traditions. I participated in Alternative Spring Break while at Vanderbilt, where I worked with Operation Breakthrough and Niles Home for Children, interacting with and educating young children who lived in poverty as well as tutoring and facilitating athletic activities for children with behavioral issues. I was very fortunate to be able to attend such a prestigious university and enjoy sharing my experiences and what I have learned with the Nashville community. I volunteered with an organization called Vanderbilt Students Volunteers for Science where I went with a team of other Vanderbilt students to middle school classrooms in Nashville and taught various hands-on science demonstrations. Overall, I enjoy using my unique experiences to share what I have learned with others, hopefully making a positive impact on those I meet.</p>

						<h2>Blog</h2>

						<p>"On Personal Growth": Humans are meant to change and evolve, it's in our very nature. Yet, many of us find ourselves in a seemingly inescapable rut. Whether it is a rut of inspiration, a divet in confidence, or simply becoming fixed and rigid in a comfortable way, it is important to acknowledge places where we can grow. Maslow tells us that the highest human need is self-actualization. But what is self-actualization? It is the state of embracing and seeking growth opportunities in all aspects of life. Even though it is at the top of the hierarchy, it does not have a distinct end. I really began thinking more deeply about personal growth after graduating from college. In fact, I even started this website as part of a 30 Day Growth Challenge. I had previously viewed growth as quantitative successes/failures or specfic steps or phases. Growth can also be conceptualized as a continuous process, with inherent and intentional subtleties. It does not need to be an obvious, outward step/accomplishment. Whether it is perfecting a skill or trying something completely new, we can all benefit from personal growth as well as supporting the growth of those around us.</p>
						<p>"On Making a Plan (and sticking to it)": As a natural list maker (almost to the point of obsurdity) I often find myself making plans. Since childhood, my lists have led to other lists and I wouldn't rest until all the items were checked off. However as I have gotten older and the tasks have become more complex, I, like many others, have found my lists more and more difficult to conquer. Almost nothing puts my mind at ease like taking the lists out of my head and getting them into written words. However once they are there, what happens? The tasks stare dauntingly and before long, the short term to-do becomes the long term to-do.  How can we combat this tendency?  One solution I have found effective is to list tasks with concrete due dates (even if they are just dates you semi-arbitrarily assign). Another solution is to acknowledge times that could be used more effectively. Although there is immense importance in relaxing and unwinding, there are also times where setting aside functional time can be hugely beneficial. Spending time fulfilling your plan may seem difficult, but once the habit is established, it can become just as routine as other parts of the day. Whether it is devoted time during your morning coffee or dedicated thought during a commute, progress towards your plan can be very rewarding and deserves a chance!</p>
