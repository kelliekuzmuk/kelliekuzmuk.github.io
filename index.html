		 <b>Vanderbilt Office of Undergraduate Admissions</b>, 2015-present
	      			<p><i>Admissions Counselor/Evaluator</i></p>
	      	<p>		
I currently work for Vanderbilt University’s Office of Undergraduate Admissions as an Admissions Counselor.  I plan, manage, and execute travel and recruitment domestically and internationally in Arkansas, Mississippi, Western Tennessee, Upstate New York, and Canada.  My role includes advising and advocating for students within the context of a high volume, highly selective admissions process.</p>

 				<p><i>VUceptor</i></p> 
 		<p>
I had the honor of being a part of VUcept during all 4 undergraduate years at Vanderbilt. VUcept is a peer mentorship program where I led 3 groups of ~20 first year students, offering guidance and helping students connect with campus resources.  I coordinated 14 weeks of student engaged sessions and programming with a faculty partner.</p>

						<h2>Interests</h2>
					</header>
						<p>I enjoy running, travel, and engaging with the community around me. Along with running for Vanderbilt's NCAA Division I Women's Cross Country and Track teams, I also volunteered with Girls on the Run to share my passion for running with girls in the Nashville community. I remained involved with Vanderbilt's Athletic Department by becoming an academic tutor for student athletes. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to study abroad during the Summer of 2012 at the University of Stirling in Scotland. During my time in Scotland, I grew to appreciate the unique culture as well as the beautiful juxtaposition of modern urban life and historic traditions. I participated in Alternative Spring Break while at Vanderbilt, where I cared for young children living with the stresses of poverty at Operation Breakthrough and tutored and facilitated athletic activities for children facing abuse or behavioral issues at Niles Home for Children.  I volunteered with an organization called Vanderbilt Students Volunteers for Science where I went with a team of other Vanderbilt students to middle school classrooms in Nashville and taught various hands-on science demonstrations.</p>
